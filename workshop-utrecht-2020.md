Reliable services in research infrastructures can only be provided with good technology as the backbone.

Implementing quality control is therefore a core objective to improve services offered to users.
Awareness of the need for software quality is rising throughout the research community.
Not only infrastructure operators promote increased investments, the cause has also been recognised by funders
and defined as a core requirement for participation in research infrastructures and the European Open Science Cloud.

At this workshop, we will discuss how domain specific infrastructures can and must bridge the gap
between abstract expectations of Technology Readiness and production level service management on one side,
and the challenges of every-day software development in the public sector (and research in particular) on the other.

The workshop has a number of contributions provided by experts from domain-specific Research Infrastructures,
broader e-Infrastructures and include aspects such as teaching and enabling adoption.
The topics addressed range from abstract quality measures and criteria to concrete implementation through automation and continuous integration.
This includes practical implementation examples of automation solutions and services,
training and teaching for students and a focus particular will be placed on how to apply the principles and technologies in research.
