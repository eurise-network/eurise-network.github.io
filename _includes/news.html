                  <h3>Registration is now open for the third EURISE Workshop!</h3>
                    <p>
                      The workshop will focus on “Software Quality through Automation and Testing” and take place on March 26 at the Spinoza Hall, University of Utrecht.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      We will discuss how domain specific infrastructures can and must bridge the gap between abstract expectations of Technology Readiness and production level service management on one side, and the challenges of every-day software development in the public sector (and research in particular) on the other. The topics to be addressed range from quality measures and criteria to implementation through automation and continuous integration and how their adoption towards ‘business as usual’ can be enabled.
                    </p>
                    <p>
