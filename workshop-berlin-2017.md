*Centre Marc Bloch, Berlin (DE), October 9--10, 2017*

See the [report in the DHd-Blog](https://dhd-blog.org/?p=8685).

Various efforts are being undertaken to address different aspects of the overall problem of sustainability.
As part of the [ESFRI process](http://www.esfri.eu/), the field of digital research infrastructures is being advanced through individual projects.
These have worked on Software Maturity Models (CESSDA) and a Service Life Cycle (DARIAH) and created general Software Quality Guidelines (CLARIAH),
informing the basis of all development efforts and processes.
During the workshop, we will be introduced to these concepts and the problems they address.
On the second day, we will spread into group sessions to discuss possible connections between them as well as the missing links.


The workshop is inspired by ongoing discussions within DARIAH, Humanities at Scale, DESIR and beyond.
It brings together leading experts from the digital research infrastructures [CESSDA](https://www.cessda.eu/),
[CLARIN](https://www.clarin.eu/) and [DARIAH](http://www.dariah.eu/) in an effort to engage with the wider community.
